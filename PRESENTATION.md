# WELCOME TO OUR STEGANOGRAPHIC IMAGE DECODING/ENCODING TOOL

## Explaining stegsolve
  Let's dive into an image! Images can have meta data, but a core source of
  information space is in their pixels. Obviously images range in pixel
  quantity, but each pixel contains four byte-sized channels, which is 32 bits
  per pixel!
  stegsolv.jar, that lovely program we're all glad to have access to via the
  cyber_resources folder, allows you to look into those 32 pockets for a whole
  image.
