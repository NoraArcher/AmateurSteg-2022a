# Everyone Loves Homework, Right?
*In a text file named stegcraigbeg.txt, write each flag along with where it was found.*

## A Familiar Problem
  Find dark.png in the data folder and rename it to YourImage.png, or open up
  the processing file and change the two occurrences of "YourImage" in the
  setup() to "dark".

## Once more around carousel
  We named this one really creatively... problem2.png

## Who would've thought of this pun
  Try to see if there's anything special in stegosaurus.png
  
## Challenge! *optional*
  Can you find the flag in problem3.png?

## Opinion: Monkeys All Around
  We are definitely monkeys. Yes?
