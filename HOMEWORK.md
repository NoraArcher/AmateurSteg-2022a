## A Familiar Problem
  Find dark.png in the data folder and rename it to YourImage.png, or open up
  the processing file and change the two occurrences of "YourImage" in the
  setup() to "dark".

  THM{7h3r3_15_h0p3_1n_7h3_d4rkn355}


## It's never that straightforward
  This should be an enciphered flag

  flag{c3VwZXJ0cm9vcGVy} --> flag{supertrooper}

## Just kidding!
  Another basic encoded text one, flag{dancing_queen}

In a text file, write each flag along with where it was found.
