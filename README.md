# AmateurSteg-2022a
Okay this is what where we work, but our final final thing will be a separate repo that our classmates can clone into

Draft For that repo:

Hi! This repo contains an amateur recreation of stegsolve with processing that you can use to
to find information encoded in images through steganography.

First make sure you have Processing 3 installed!
Then clone this with git clone git@github.com:NoraArcher/AmateurSteg-2022a.git

Then you can open FilterRotation.pde with processing from the repository.
Please add the image you want to investigate to the processing file and rename it YourImage.png
