# AmateurSteg-2022a
Hi! This repo contains an amateur recreation of stegsolve with processing that you can use to
to find information encoded in images through steganography.

First, make sure you have Processing 3 installed! We assume that all users will have this application to run the program. 
Then, clone this with git clone git@github.com:NoraArcher/AmateurSteg-2022a.git

After that, you can open FilterRotation.pde with Processing 3 from the repository.
Please add the image you want to investigate to FilterRotation/data and rename it "YourImage.png"

Button Controls:
The Red Button in the bottom right corner rotates the filter methods ranging from the XOR method to the isolation method. 

*Please note that if the image goes beyond the set screen size you can simply adjust the code directly with little to no impact on functionality.*
