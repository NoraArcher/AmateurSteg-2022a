# AmateurSteg-2022a
Hi! This repo contains an amateur recreation of stegsolve with processing that you can use to
to find information encoded in images through steganography.

First make sure you have Processing 3 installed!
Then clone this with git clone git@github.com:NoraArcher/AmateurSteg-2022a.git

Then you can open FilterRotation.pde with processing from the repository.
Please add the image you want to investigate to FilterRotation/data and rename it "YourImage.png"

*Please note that if the image goes beyond the set screen size you can simply adjust the code directly with little to no impact on functionality.*
